# Feature Scaling Tool environment variables
#
# This project primarily uses config.yaml for configuration. Environment variables
# are optional and can be used to override runtime settings if you extend the tool.
#
# Do not store secrets in this file. Copy to ".env" locally if needed.
#
# Example:
# FEATURE_SCALING_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
